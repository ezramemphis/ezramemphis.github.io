      <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a boy who truly believed he could 
        do anything — once he dreamed about microwaving a burrito so hot that not even he 
        could eat it. His confidence was unmatched, his haircut questionable, 
        and his optimism slightly delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, he decided he would become a great music producer. 
        He downloaded every free plugin known to man and started making 
        beats that sounded like a printer fighting a fax machine. 
        But to him, it was genius.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came his next goal: passing Intro to Programming. 
        Unfortunately, the boy thought “debugging” meant swatting 
        flies with a keyboard. Still, he persevered, mostly by just spamming
        ChatGPT until he was able to get the assignments finished
      </p>
       <p>
        He decided one day to make a list of all of his dreams, so that 
        he could achieve them one by one. The list included as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Getting a girl</li>
        <li>Becoming a great music producer</li>
        <li>Affording rent</li>
        <li>Making his parents proud</li>
        <li>Having friends</li>
        <li>Getting good grades</li>
        <li>Passing Intro to Programming</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As time went on, he tried to balance love, music, and rent — 
        all while eating instant noodles like a champion. His parents were a little
        concerned as he wasn't defeating the bum allegations, but aye, dude was trying.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, the boy didn’t quite achieve everything he wanted. Really not any of
        them to be frank. But he did achieve something even better: becoming a legend among his friends 
        for his unmatched ability to "almost succeed" at everything he tried. 
        And honestly, that’s inspiring.
